math
----
1. calculate
    2*3 ==> infinite loop
    2sin(3)

2. list options
    7. liner regression ==> doesn't work

3. matrix
    edit matrix ==> matrix4 (for ex) will still proceed. Later this throws caught error later

4. graph
    could not get it integrated

5. integrate ==> ? doesn't work at all

6. summation ==> ? doesn't work at all perhaps


graphing
--------
seg faults (sin applies to all trig functions)
    n sin(x)
    sin(n x)
    sin(n * x)
